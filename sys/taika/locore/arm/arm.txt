ARM Architecture Notes
----------------------

- registers r0..r12, r13 (sp), r14 (lr), r15 (pc)
  - sp; stack pointer
  - lr; link register (return address)
  - pc; program counter / instruction pointer
- interrupt vector is linked at 0x00000000
- interrupt vector has branch instructions and in-place fast interrupt handler

System Call Interface
---------------------

- pass system call number in r7; arguments in r0, r1, r2, r3
