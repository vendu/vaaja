# Deck Soft-Processor Project

In this directory tree I'm attempting to design a small and simple processor
for playing around with FPGA gear; I'd hope this would be helpful for the
purposes of education and fun.

The project is early, but it's based on a few different pseudo-designs I've come
up with in past. It was actually inspired by the game project Mjolnir; I thought
a cyberpunk-style Roguelike game could use small computers called decks, one
thought lead to another and I realized why not mess around a bit with something
like this. I still have an FPGA-kit waiting to be put in real use.

One of my visions is to implement a retro-style game console with a custom
32-bit microprocessor, VGA-graphics (my current FPGA-kit does 4,096-colors),
connectors for keyboards and mice, and a couple of digital joystick ports as
well as, of course, audio output.

Thanks for your interest. :)
