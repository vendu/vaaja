Zen System Kernel
-----------------

Welcome to the Zen kernel. Zen will be a flexible, easily extendable, highly
configurable kernel adoptable for different computing scenarios from audio-
visual workstations to servers and computer farms.

Feel free to browse the code, keeping in mind a lot of it is early and may be
untested and buggy. It's the big picture that matters at this stage.

I want to thank the whole hacker community for their marvelous contributions to
the field of computer science. Thank you for Unix as well as its descendants
C, The X Window System, other software and hardware systems too numerous to list
in this brief text.
