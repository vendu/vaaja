Welcome to the Vaaja project. :)

The name originates from our language (Finnish) and means the same - hammer - in
sanskrit.

The goal of the Vaaja project is a new microprocessor + support software such as
an operating system kernel (called Zen); the initial plan includes a 32-bit game
console with retro-style 2D sprite-based graphics.

I will keep hacking and write more documentation in due time. I'm going to keep
the project open and free of charge for private and educational purposes; I'm
not a rich man, so in case you feel like placing a donation (I could use a bit
more FPGA-hardware), please contact me and let's see what we can come up with.

Let's hack the planet!
