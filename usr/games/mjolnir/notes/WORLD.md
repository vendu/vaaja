# World of Mjolnir

## Post-Apocalyptic Setting

A huge majority of the human race was killed by the Big War of 2051. Several
states launched missiles against each other causing massive damage to the
surface of planet Earth, causing and leaving the rest of humans with fatal
radiation to big parts of our home.

Due to high radiation levels most of the creatures living on the surface of
Earth are zombies or other forms of supernatural undead.

## Information is Power

Virtually all magnetic media was destroyed during the massive EMP-attacks of
the War, and most of optical media during most of the world burning down.

Portable computers utilise punchcards, and most of the tapes are rolling within
the same deep underground bunkers as the mainframce computers.
