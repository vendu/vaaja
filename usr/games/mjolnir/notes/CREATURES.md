# Mjolnir Creature Guide

Instead of using the typical AD&D characters and items in the game, I'm thinking
of mixing deities and characters from different sources such as Norse and
Finnish mythologies, even Christianity. In addition, some characters in the
game are based on common horror stories such as John Sinclair adventures from
'Jason Dark'. Here are some current ideas for in-game characters.

## The List of Creatures

### @ - the player

## Non-Player Creatures

### a - ant (STR:0 HIT:1d4)

Ants are easy opponents to defaeat, except perhaps when they appear in masses.

### A - soldier ant (STR:2 HIT:2d4)

Soldier ants are the strongest type of ants.

### b - bee (STR:2 HIT:2d4)

Bees are relatively easy opponents, for they can only sting once after which
they die. Bees will do anything to protect their queen. Bee stings can be
dangerous in the tens or hundreds.

### B - bee queen (STR:4 HIT:3d4)

Bee queens may not be a good idea to attack, especially with lots of other bees
in vicinity.

### d - dog (STR: 8 HIT:1d12)

Your pet dog is smart and may bring you things after which it would be a good
idea to feed it. The dog may hit small creatures to defend you. Don't forget to
feed your beloved dog now and again, even though it eats corpses of the monsters you slay.

### e - alien/extraterrestrial creature (STR:64 HIT:3d20)

Aliens may have superhuman powers, and as such, can be tricky opponents to beat
in combat.

### g - ghoul (STR:64 HIT:3d20)

Ghouls are corpse-eaters, therefore common around graveyards. Ghoul wounds may
cause infections which may even be deadly. Ghouls can use the guise of an
animal, especially a hyena. Ghouls drink blood, steal gold, and eat the dead,
then taking the form of the person most recently eaten.

### H - human (STR:16 HIT:2d6)

Human beings are usally friendly unless you attack them. You may get rare items
by looting human remnants or by trading items with them.

### O - oracle (STR:32 HIT:2d20)

Oracles share pieces of wisdow to give you hints for the game.

### r - rat (STR:4 HIT:1d8), 50 % chance of a bite causing infection

A typical sewer rat, bites may lead to infections without proper salve. Among
the very easiest opponents in combat.

### S - shopkeeper (STR:128 HIT:4d20), mid CHA

A shopkeeper is a hard opponent, as he likely carries a cut-sawn shotgun or some
other weapon.

### u - unicorn (STR:16 HIT:2d6)
### v - vampire (STR:64 HIT:3d20), vampire infection from bite, mid CHA
### w - (were)wolf (STR:64 HIT:3d20), werewolf infection from bite
### W - wizard (STR:32 HIT:2d20), very good at spellcasting, high PSI, INTEL,
        MAGIC, CAST
### z - zombie (STR:64 HIT:3d20)

# Special Creatures

## Deities

### F - Fenris (the guardian and petwolf of gods, himself the god of wolves) (STR:256 HIT:6d20)

Fenris has turned evil and stolen Mjolnir the hammer from Thor. Your mission is
to bring his tool back to Thor, although you may experiment by sacrificing the
hammer to other superhuman beings.

### T - Thor (the viking god of thunder) (STR:512 HIT:10d20, Mjolnir:20d20)

### U - Ukko Ylijumala (Ukko 'Overlord' from Finnish mythologies) (STR:512 HIT:10d20, Vaaja:15d20)

An ancient Finnish belief concerns Ukko to be 'the god of gods'.

### K - Kara (the princess of Atlantis) (STR:128 HIT:4d20)

Kara carries a golden sword which she may drop for you to use when the going
gets really tough. :)

## Other Supernatural Beings

### V - Dracula (master vampire Vlad the Impaler) (STR:128 HIT:4d20)

Dracula is the most powerful of all vampires. Oftentimes, he can be found at the
Bran Castle in Transylvania.

### X - Lady X (undead terrorist vampire) (STR:128 HIT:4d20)

Lady X carries a submachine gun which may be loaded with silver bullets.
