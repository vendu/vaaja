# Mjolnir Introduction

Mjolnir is a game in the Rogue-like genre that is based on characters and items,
and deities from different mythologies as well as perhaps more traditional
animals, horror creatures such as vampires, werewolves, zombies and ghouls, as
well as special weapons and items that are related to common religious beliefs.

The game levels are generated procedurally, somewhat randomly on the fly. This
makes every single game unique and different from all other games.

## A Bit of Cyberpunk

I thought it might be a good idea to mix some cyberpunk vibes into the game;
the dungeons, therefore, have punchcards and tapes with stored programs as well
as terminals and mainframes for running the software. The software shall range
from Core War Redcode development environment to different cracks to tap in on
and forge network traffic. Terminals typically come with punchcard slots to read
and write programs on punchcards.

# Game Time

The game time is designed to be advanced by 10 seconds every turn. However, when
not doing anything, the game advances in real time. It's a good idea to get
shelter for before you go idle.

# Game Start

At the beginning of game, you will have the following possessions
f - 4 food rations
~ - 8 potions of water
G - a bit of Gleipnir
x - the blessed silver cross of Ezekiel
| - the rod of Buddha

# Levels and Quests

Different levels [and quests] in the game feature themed environment and
characters to interact with.

Once you have returned Mjolnir to Thor or Ukko, you will be ascended to demigod-
hood by the corresponding god. In short, you win the game.

The ground level has locations such as shops, offices, other buildings, and
graveyards.

Your quests on the surface of Earth include a digital bank robbery or two as
well as trying to hunt down as many demons haunting people as you can.

## Transylvania

Your quest in Transylvania is to slay the master vampire Vlad Dracula alias
Vlad III Tepes. He's often present at the Bran castle; welcome to the vampire

## Monastery

The monks you run into are highly-educated ones with some being experts on demon
and ghost hunting. Pay attention to the monastery library.

# Levels 1-8 - Dungeons

The dungeon levels consist of procedurally generated rooms and walls generated
procedurally, somewhat pseudo-randomly, to guarantee a unique experience every

The oracle gives useful hints at different prices - the more you pay, the better
advice.

The Death Labyrinth is a place ruled by the daughter of Asmodeus aka Lucifer,
Asmodina. Common shapes of Asmodina include that of a young woman as well as
the snake Apep. Beating Asmodina will require use of white magic weaponry.

Hell is where Lucifer the fallen angel aka Satan rules the game. Your mission is
to either eliminate Asmodis or escape from Hell.
