# Krak; Crack the System Game

- different character classes have different base skills and talent (efficiency
  to develop the skill) for Krak
- a turn starts by a throw of HITDIE (D6) to determine how many cards the
  player is allowed to play during the turn
- an attack' strength is determined by the following formula;

  HIT = XP / 4 + POWER + LUCK + SKILL;

  where XP is the character's experience level in krak, PWR is hit power (D6 by
  default), LUCK is luck factor (D4 by default), and finally SKILL is a per-
  character-type SKILL for krak;
  - HIT         - attack strength in hitpoints
  - POWER is a per-character die (according to XP)
  - LUCK is determined as a function of KARMA in a predefined way (given die for
    the karma value)
  - SKILL is the per-character krak-skill value (evolves depending on TALENT)
