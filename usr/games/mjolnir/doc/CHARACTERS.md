## game characters

To make the most fun off the game and keep it playable on old terminals too,
the standard "graphics" are drawn as characters.

Instead of using the typical AD&D characters and items in the game, I'm thinking
of mixing deities and characters from different sources such as Norse mythologies
and even Christianity. In addition, some characters in the game are based on
common horror stories such as John Sinclair adventures from 'Jason Dark'. Here
are some current ideas for in-game characters.

### @ - the player

### a - ant

Ants are easy opponents to defaeat, except perhaps when they appear en masse.

### A - soldier ant

Soldier ants are the strongest type of ants.

### B - bee hive
- you may acquire honey from these; one queen per hive.

### b - bee

Bees are relatively easy opponents, for they can only sting once after which
they die. Bees will do anything to protect their queen.

### q - bee queen

Bee queens may not be a good idea to attack, especially with lots of other bees
in vicinity.

### d - dog

Your pet dog is smart and may bring you things after which it would be a good
idea to feed it. The dog may hit small creatures to defend you. Don't forget to
feed your beloved dog now and again, even though it eats corpses of the monsters
you slay.

### e - alien/extraterrestrial creature

Aliens may have superhuman powers, and as such, can be tricky opponents to beat
in combat.

### g - ghoul

Ghouls are corpse-eaters, therefore common around graveyards. Ghoul wounds may
cause infections which may even be deadly. Ghouls can use the guise of an
animal, especially a hyena. Ghouls drink blood, steal gold, and eat the dead,
then taking the form of the person most recently eaten.

### H - human

Human beings are usally friendly unless you attack them. You may get rare items
by looting human remnants or by trading items with them.

### O - oracle

Oracles share pieces of wisdow to give you hints for the game.

### r - rat
### R - remnants
### £ - shopkeeper
### u - unicorn
### v - vampire
### w - wolf
### W - werewolf
### Z - zombie

## special characters

### I - Iku-Turso
### F - Fenris
### K - Kara
### T - Thor
### V - Lady X (undead terrorist vampire)
### D - Dracula
