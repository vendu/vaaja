# KRAKSYS Board Game

KRAKSYS is a quick-to-play board game for 2-4 players. A game should last
approximately 15-60 minutes.

## Getting Started

In the beginning of the game, each player chooses player element of water, wind,
fire, or land. This element is kept secret from other players.

A roll of D6 determines the skill factor for each player as follows
- the value 1 indicates we shall use D4 to roll for luck
- the value 2 indicates we shall use D6 to roll for luck
- the value 3 indicates we shall use D6 to roll for luck
- the value 4 indicates we shall use D8 to roll for luck
- the value 5 indicates we shall use D8 to roll for luck
- the value 6 indicates we shall use D12 to roll for luck

A roll of D4 determines the magic skill (the number of spells you may use in
combinations).

each player gets the following items (first listed for 2-player sessions)

- 4 mainframe cards
- 10 element pieces; 4 x native element, 2 x other 3 elements
  - alternatively, you may use 20 element pieces (8 x native element, 4 x other
    3 elements) for longer gameplay
- up to 24 spell cards; D6 x frost, D6 x tornado, D6 x tsunami, D6 x earthquake
- 2 thief cards; steal a [blindly-picked] card from an opponent's deck
- 2 swap cards; swap a card with [blindly-picked] one from an opponent's deck
- 2 probe cards; identify opponent card on the board (turn it face up)
- 2 trojan cards; try to infect/capture attacking pieces
- 2 emp cards; try to deactivate a mainframe
- D8 x heal cards

After the initial steps for the player, they populate the S1-S10 cells with
spell cards face down.

P1-P10 are populated with element pieces.

## Game Goal

Your mission in the game is to crack and capture as many mainframes as possible.
You have captured a mainframe when you have at least 50 % of its live plugs
jacked. You may kill plugs with EMP-cards. Captured mainframes may not be taken
back from you.

## Gameplay

A turn beings by a player moving a piece forward, left, or right; you are not
allowed to move pieces back towards your home location (your S and P columns).
Diagonal moves are allowed.

If you move the piece on top of an opponent card, a combat is triggered between
your element piece and the opponent card; more details on rolling dice and other
game mechanics below.

You may opt to combine 1 or more spell cards with the attack; the maximum number
depends on you magic skill level (throwing the respective dice).

You now roll the die, then the dice for each spell respectively and add the
figures to each other.

Finally, you roll the luck die and add it to the current sum of figures to
determine the total hit strength of your attack.

If the attack leads to a die the attacking player wins and the opponent card
just beaten is discarded from the board. The player may but does not have to
replace the card with their own action card (see Action Cards below).

## Actions

The game actions are attack, defense, and spell combinations.

## Dice

KRAKSYS Gameplay is based on D20 set of dice with dices of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and
20 points.

Here, I list some default actions for the different dice.
