# Mjolnir Video Game

## Basic Plot

The wolf of gods, Fenris, has turned evil and stolen his hammer Mjolnir from
Thor. Your duty is to bring Mjolnir back from the depths of the dungeon of
Tuoni. Along your adventure, you will be faced with puzzles, battles with other
game characters, and a bit of magic.

## Implementation

Mjolnir will be implemented in C. The graphics will be 2D or "2.5D" (isometric)
rendered on 2D-screens. Graphical objects, "sprites", will have mask bitmaps to
choose which pixels of them to draw for different shapes. The audio will be
CD-rate digital signal mixed with output from synthesizers and other audio
equipment. Graphics will [initially] be bitmapped.
