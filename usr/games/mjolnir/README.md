# Mjolnir

Mjolnir is an open source computer game project. The goal is a rogue-like
dungeon crawler with a cyberpunk-style seting. The Big War has wiped a huge
majority of the population off the planet, so most of the surface of Earth
is inhabitated by demons/undead. With such radiation levels, the remaining
rew thousand people live in an underworld called New Atlantis.

More than 90 % of the capital of the planet is controlled with a handful of
Mega-corporations expertising in the sales of products such as pharmaceuticals,
food, hemp, security, and entertainment.

Digital crime is today. A lot of money is stolen via illicit credit cards,
stolen and counterfeit. Stolen and illicit goods such such as consumer
electronics, dope, and firearms is blooming.
