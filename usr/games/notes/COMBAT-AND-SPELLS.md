# VD20 Combat and Spells

This is an early design
document of VD20 RPG-like
game system. I plan on
using the system for my
KrakSys board game,
Mjolnir rogue-like
computer game and other
projects.

As the name VD20 hints,
the system is implemented
for the D20 dice set with
dies of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
and 20 points.

# Close Combat; Budo

## Basic Mechanics

Close combat ranks are based on karate belts. Combat
proceeds as follows.

- the dice are rolled for the hit
  - HIT = STRENGTH + ATTACK
- the success die is rolled for the attacker
- the reflex dice are rolled for the defender
  - success indicates the attacker misses

If the player chooses element combat

- the dice are rolled for the hit
  - D8 for a weak hit
  - 3+D8 for an equal hit
  - 6+D8 for a strong hit
- the cycle is continued until one element is out of hitpoints
  or flees
