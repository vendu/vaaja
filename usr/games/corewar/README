This directory holds an early implementation of Core War as described in the included PDF.

To build the programs, run

	./build.sh

NOTE: you will need an imlib2 package installed; some systems require
you to install a dev version to get the header files installed.

I have included a few .rc-suffix example warriors. To try vendetta against vendetta2, do
	./cw vendetta.rc vendetta2.rc

For the visualisation, do

	./zeus vendetta.rc vendetta2.rc

Enjoy! :)

P.S. I know, it's still a bit rough around the edges... :)
