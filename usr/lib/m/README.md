This directory contains a mathematics library based on code and documentation
from myself, The Open Group, MIT, FreeBSD, IBM, most likely Sun Microsystems,
AT&T, Microsoft Corporation and possibly other parties.

FPUs are utilised in assembly where necessary.

I want to extend personal thanks to everyone whose code and documentation I have
had the wonderful chance to study. :)
