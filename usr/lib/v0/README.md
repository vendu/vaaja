# V0 Microprocessor + Tools

## Preface

V0, aka Velho 0, aims to implement a high-performance, programmer-friendly
microprocessor in concert of the development toolchain and other software for
the system.

This directory tree consists of a V0 simulator ("virtual machine") in the vm-
directory, as well as later a Verilog implementation of the microprocessor in
the rtl-directory.
