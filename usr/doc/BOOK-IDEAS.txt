The Design and Implementation of the Velho Microprocessor
---------------------------------------------------------

Copyright (C) 2020 Tuomo Venäläinen

- separate caches for code and data
- pipelined execution
- implemented in Verilog, C-based code generators
- RISC-inspired (RISC-V, Cray 1) with extra features for certain aspects of code
  optimization.

Velho Machine Architecture 1 - The Programmer's Manual
------------------------------------------------------

- the goal of the book; education, fun
- preface; modern high-performance game console
- thanks; unix-homeage, bsd, linux, internet and foss communities
- V0 machine environment
  - V0 instruction set reference
  - registers
  - memory subsystem
  - I/O-interfaces
  - audio/mixer daemon
  - video framebuffer (4,096-color pixels, something like 720x480 resolution)

Zen Kernel
----------

- first off, static-priority threads for a game engine (the first goal for the
  platform is a retro-style game console)
- later on, thread scheduling based on ULE, BVT, or somesuch interactive thread
  scheduler
